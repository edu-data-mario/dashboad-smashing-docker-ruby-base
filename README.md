# dashboad smashing docker ruby base
- I thought of dashing at the educational scene and found a nice fork.
- Ruby is still an attractive language and in the new 3.x version, I want to create and deploy a docker with an easy installation where "smashing" works well. I've had a lot of help with other great open sources.
- express one's appreciation to all.
